## WIFI INTRODUCTION

WIFI is a wireless communication technology that uses radio frequency signals to transmit data. It is widely used in various fields such as smart home, industrial control, and Internet of Things.

## WIFI MODULE - ESP8266 and ESP_01S

### Introduction of ESP8266

ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world, produced by Espressif. It offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor.

### Introduction of ESP_01S

Ai-Thinker ESP_01S is a low-power, cost-effective embedded Wi-Fi module, which is based on the ESP8266 chip from Espressif.
