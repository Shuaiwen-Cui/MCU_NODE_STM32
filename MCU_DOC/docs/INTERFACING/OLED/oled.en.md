# OLED

## OLED INTRODUCTION

OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) is a type of display technology that uses organic compounds to produce light. It is a self-emissive display, which means that it does not require a backlight to function. OLED displays are known for their high contrast ratio, wide viewing angles, and fast response times. They are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices.
