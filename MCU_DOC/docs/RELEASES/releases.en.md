## STABLE RELEASES

| Release (Folder Name) | Description | Features | Status | Notes |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
| NODE-CORE-R2024-Aug| This release focuses on the computational core development. | for Main Control | ✅ Stable | Will not be adopted in future |
| NODE-CORE-R2024-Sep| This release focuses on the computational core development, featuring new architecture and all-in-one setup | for Main Control | ✅ Stable | 🏆 Recommended, New Architecture |
<!-- | NODE-CORE-BUILDING| This release focuses on the computational core development, showing the development progress of the core components. | Computaitonal Core Development - Progress View | ✅ Ready | Theoretically equivalent to NODE-CORE-BUILT, but not fully tested. | -->
<!-- | NODE-CORE-INTERACTION-BUILT| This release focuses on the computational core development, showing the developed computational core. Compared to the non-interactive version, this version removes the interrupt and DMA functions of the serial port, only retains the basic serial port input and output, and supports user input (single character) for interactive menu functions. | Computaitonal Core Development - Interaction View | ✅ Stable | 🏆 Recommended | -->
<!-- | NODE-FULL-BUILDING| This release focuses on the full system development, showing the development progress of the full system. | Full System Development - Progress View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - |
| NODE-CORE-RTOS-BUILDING| This release focuses on the computational core development with RTOS, showing the development progress of the core components. | Computaitonal Core Development with RTOS - Progress View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - |
| NODE-CORE-RTOS-BUILT| This release focuses on the computational core development with RTOS, showing the developed computational core with RTOS. | Computaitonal Core Development with RTOS - Built View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - | -->
