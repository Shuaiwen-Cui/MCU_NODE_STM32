# RELEASES

To faciliate different use cases, this project provides various releases. The following table lists the available releases and their respective features.

| Release (Folder Name) | Description | Features | Status | Notes |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
| NODE-CORE-BUILDING| This release focuses on the computational core development, showing the development progress of the core components. | Computaitonal Core Development - Progress View | ✅ Ready | Theoretically equivalent to NODE-CORE-BUILT, but not fully tested. |
| NODE-CORE-BUILT| This release focuses on the computational core development, showing the developed computational core. | Computaitonal Core Development - Built View | ✅ Stable | 🏆 Recommended |
| NODE-CORE-INTERACTION-BUILT| This release focuses on the computational core development, showing the developed computational core. Compared to the non-interactive version, this version removes the interrupt and DMA functions of the serial port, only retains the basic serial port input and output, and supports user input (single character) for interactive menu functions. | Computaitonal Core Development - Interaction View | ✅ Stable | 🏆 Recommended |
<!-- | NODE-FULL-BUILDING| This release focuses on the full system development, showing the development progress of the full system. | Full System Development - Progress View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - |
| NODE-CORE-RTOS-BUILDING| This release focuses on the computational core development with RTOS, showing the development progress of the core components. | Computaitonal Core Development with RTOS - Progress View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - |
| NODE-CORE-RTOS-BUILT| This release focuses on the computational core development with RTOS, showing the developed computational core with RTOS. | Computaitonal Core Development with RTOS - Built View | 🏗️ Not Ready | - | -->
